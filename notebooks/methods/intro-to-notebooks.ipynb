    "# Intro to Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are interactive coding environments composed of sequential cells where each cell is either code or documentation (like this first text cell). If no code cells are added, they are essentially a text document. When code cells are used they can run specific programming languages (originally [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/), hence `Ju Py ter`) but also command line operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can take advantage of this combination: command line, code, and documentation to produce notebooks that lay out how to use a tool or method, and easily share it with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a sample notebook where we showcase the basic operations you need to know to navigate the open source research notebooks in this repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although you can install and run Jupyter on your computer, it can become a hassle depending on your operating system, app versions, and so on. So we advise you to start with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) which is like any other Google document but instead of slides or spreadsheets it's a Jupyter Notebook you get. You can [open this very notebook on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bellingcat/open-source-research-notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/methods/intro-to-notebooks.ipynb) and execute it there, you can also just [view it on GitHub](https://github.com/bellingcat/open-source-research-notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/methods/intro-to-notebooks.ipynb) but that will be a static version.\n",
    "\n",
    "We **strongly** advise you to watch [this 3min video on Google Colab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI) and come back to run the cells in this notebook. The internet is full of great tutorials for Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, and more notebook environments.\n",
